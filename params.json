The game is currently a work in progress.\r\n\r\n## Build\r\n\r\nTo build, compile main.c with your system's C compiler (gcc, clang, cc, whatever) If you're on macOS, you can use the handy build.sh script. \r\n\r\n## Game Details\r\n\r\nThis game can run on basically any system with a keyboard and a terminal. It's only been tested on macOS, but it doesn't use any external libraries so it shouldn't be a issue.",
